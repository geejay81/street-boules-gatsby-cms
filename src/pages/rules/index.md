## Objective
The objective of Street Boules is to score points by strategically throwing colored plastic boules filled with water as close as possible to the Jack, a smaller target ball, on the fine gravel pitch.

## Gameplay
1. The game starts with a process known as "jacking off." One team tosses the Jack onto the pitch to begin the round.
2. The team that successfully jacks off gets the first throw.
3. Teams take turns throwing their four boules each, aiming to land them as close to the Jack as possible.
4. Players must stand behind the designated throwing line until it's their turn to throw.
5. After all eight boules have been thrown (four from each team), players are allowed to pick up and re-throw two of their own boules to improve their positions.
6. This strategic move, known as a "pick-up," can significantly impact the round's outcome.

## Scoring
1. After all boules have been thrown and re-thrown, the team with one or more boules closer to the Jack than their opponent's closest boule scores points.
2. Points are awarded based on the number of boules closer to the Jack:
    - If one team has the closest boule to the Jack, they score 1 point.
    - If one team has the two closest boules, they score 2 points.
    - If one team has the three closest boules, they score 3 points.
    - If one team has the four closest boules, they score 4 points.

## Winning the Match
1. The game continues until one team reaches a total of ten points.
2. The first team to reach ten points is declared the winner.

## Pitch Etiquette
1. Players must remain behind the throwing line until it's their turn to throw.
2. During the pick-up phase, players are allowed to cross over the line onto the pitch to retrieve boules.

## Additional Guidelines
1. Boules that hit boundaries or go out of bounds are considered out of play and are not counted for scoring.
2. Each player must stand within a designated throwing area while throwing the boules.
3. Players must not step into the playing area until the previous player has completed their turn.
